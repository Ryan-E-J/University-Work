# University-Work
Work completed whilst at university, some aspects of programs will be incomplete and most of these will not be completed in the future. If projects are improved upon they will have an original folder and an upgraded folder.

Advanced Programming was a module that was created using C++, the program's purpose was to find solutions to a word search in the quickest time possible. Section 1 of this program is working however I did not complete section 2 which required a more advanced algorithm, this currently my first and only project in C++ with plans to create a new personal one over summer.

AI was a module that was created in Prolog, the AI is a very simple chatbot that only responds to certain sentences however it works with multiple synonyms of the words required.

Games Architecture was a Pacman clone developed in C#, this used the libraries of OpenGL and OpenAL to help render the objects and create audio within the game. The Ghosts' AI within the game are very simple and just bounce off walls in a random direction, with more time I would have added path finding to these ghosts. Another simplistic aspect is the collisions, there is a glitch with this as if you stop in just the correct location you can clip through objects, the best way I have found to fix this is changing the algorithm completely.

Networking was a location program that stored the locations of users that submitted their locations. Another user could also check to see where other users are as this is the primary feature of the program. The client features a UI that allows users to operate the program in a simple manner with instructions on each section. If the user wishes they can also open the client in a console version however this requires an arg to be done.

As an informal final words, there are more projects that I have developed over university however these projects have been uploaded by other students as they were group projects and I can no longer get the files for. 

Thank you for looking through my University Projects.
